Mohinga AIMS
============

This is the repository for Catalpa Internationalâ€™s Aid Transparency portal currently allowing the public and agencies to view registered aid activities in Myanmar.

## What is Mohinga?

Aside from being a delicious [noodle dish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohinga), [Mohinga]('http://www.mohinga.info') is Myanmar's Aid Information Management Platform. Mohinga is the first Open Source AIMS to be upon the [IATI standard] (http://iatistandard.org/) from the ground up. 


## Why is open aid important?

Making aid transparent helps to ensure aid goes where it is most needed. By ensuring open access to aid information a wider group of stakeholders are able to clearly see who is doing what and where? Access to better quality aid information also supports the equitable allocation of resources, both sectorally and geographically, ensuring that all Myanmar people can benefit.


## What are the results?

Aid transparency isn't just about numbers. Results matter too. Open access to aid information means that the people of Myanmar are better able to see the impact that aid activities have in their communities. This also helps other countries learn what may work, or not work, in their country.
